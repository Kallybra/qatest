        <h1>Hollywood Undead</h1>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Hollywood Undead is a rap-rock band from LA, California, formed in 2005. The previously destinctive feature of the band is that everyone wore their own unique mask. Although as of relatively recently they wear masks much more rare, if at all. Their genre is best described as rap-rock - a combination of the two genres, although some of their songs lean more towards one and sometimes towards the other. The band's topics vary from album to album, but most of the time the topics of the songs would include: drinking and having fun, sex, drugs, murder, depression, suicide, apocalypse etc. Combining one of those topics for a song, good lyrics which always hit, unforgetable, unique music style and their iconic horror-esque masks, it creates an unforgetful experience which hooked millions of people on them, at the peak of band's popularity.</p>

        <p>The band originated in 2005 from a song titled The Kids that Jorel Decker (J-Dog), Jeff Phillips (Shady Jeff), and Aron Erlichman (Da Produce, later Deuce) posted on the band's MySpace profile. It was originally Jeff's idea to create a heavy metal Beastie Boys type band when they were at Jorel's apartment. The so many positive reviews that they received lead them to form a group. The group soon broadened with Matthew Busek (Da Kurlzz), George Ragan (Johny 3 Tears), Jordon Terrell (Charlie Scene) and Dylan Alvarez (Funny Man). The Kids was originally titled Hollywood and the band's name was going to be Undead. The members referred as "Undead" to the kids in LA who were always on their way partying, looking like living dead. They wrote Hollywood (the song's title) and Undead (the band's name) on a CD and gave it to Decker's neighbor who thought the group was called Hollywood Undead. They all liked the name so they went for it.</p>
        <p>In an interview with Shave magazine, Decker explained that when forming the band "Whoever was in the room at the time and played an instrument was in the band." Jeff Phillips later left the band after a conflict with Erlichman. In interviews, they only said that Jeff was too old for the band and he wouldn't have fit in</p>
        <h3>The debut</h3>
        <p>The band only took one year working on their debut album, Swan Songs. The other two years were spent looking for a company that wouldn't try to censor the album. They first signed a record contract with MySpace Records in 2005 but they left the label after the label tried to censor their first album. They also tried to sign with Interscope Records but they wouldn't publish the songs uncensored. They then signed a contract with A&M/Octone Records and Swan Songs was released on September 2, 2008 and reached #22 on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 21,000 copies; which was later on released in the United Kingdom on May 18, 2009 with two bonus tracks. In December 2009, the band won Best Crunk/Rock Rap Artist at the Rock on Request Awards.</p>
        <h2>Quarrel with Deuce</h2>
        <img src="images/Deuce.jpg">
        <p>In early 2010, the band announced that singer, Deuce, had left the band due to musical differences. Hints of Deuce's departure were noticed when he did not take part in the Vatos Locos tour. After a couple weeks on tour, the band asked long-time friend, Daniel Murillo (Danny), to fill in for Deuce's role. This was not too long after Murillo had just advanced past the auditions for season 9 of American Idol. Murillo decided to drop out of the competition and joined the band. Daniel Murillo was also the lead singer of the band, Lorene Drive, which is currently on hiatus due to his involvement with Hollywood Undead.</p>
        <p>Deuce later released a song titled Story of a Snitch against the group, claiming he was kicked out as well as that he wrote every verse and every chorus. The band stated that they didn't want to "stoop to his level" and chose to simply ignore the controversy. In mid-January, after seeing he can do just good in the studio as on shows, the band announced Daniel Murillo was an official member, going by the nickname of Danny. They explained the reason Danny chose his name as his stage name was not because of the lack of creativity, rather than it wouldn't be logical since the original band members all got their nicknames from their past and they just couldn't imagine not calling him Danny.</p>
        <p>Not much was known about the situation until the subject was brought up by interviewer Bryan Stars on YouTube. Johnny 3 Tears and Da Kurlzz told the interviewer that the band had to constantly satisfy Deuce while touring. "It was so bad, that I don't think there would've been another record if he was still with us", Da Kurlzz told the interviewer. "We bent over backwards to accommodate Deuce", he said. Johnny 3 Tears, growing weary of the subject, said, "It was just that he didn't like being on the road, so we would have to do things to make him happy. He also claimed to be writing all the songs, and all this B.S.". The band decided to drop the subject afterwards, saying that they have moved on from the situation and would prefer not putting in too much detail.</p>
        <p>Martini Beerman of rock.com interviewed Charlie Scene and J-Dog, and the two decided to explain the final events that led up to the split. Charlie Scene told the interviewer, "He wanted to have his personal assistant come on the tour. None of us have personal assistants, we're not egomaniacs. We don't need that, and he wanted the band to pay for it and we did for like four months. After that we were like, 'we're not gonna pay $800 a week to have your buddy out on tour'. We went to the airport to fly out for our next tour, and he didn't show up. We were like, what the fuck do we do? We called him and he didn't answer. So for the first two weeks of that tour, I sang all his parts." Deuce later responded to this in his own interview with Bryan Stars claiming that the personal assistant Charlie Scene spoke of was in fact Jimmy Yuma. Jimmy Yuma said that he was paid by Deuce out of his own pocket to set up equipment for him, and that the band didn't have to pay anything until he began setting up their equipment on tour also. Deuce also mentioned in the same interview that he did not show up to the tour in question because he had received a phone call from the manager previously who claimed the band had "broken up" and was told not to go on tour. During an interview with JackedUp Radio, Deuce states that one of the final disputes he had with Hollywood Undead was over having a personal Twitter account, Deuce claims that when he began to connect with fans over Twitter he was told that "if you keep twittering, you're not going to be allowed to go on tour". He released his debut album, Nine Lives, as a solo artist on April 24, 2012 under Five Seven Music and after five years, he still keeps writing diss songs towards Hollywood Undead and threatens them to sue them for assault and extortion.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion and present day</h2>
        <p>Hollywood Undead has had its ups and downs since the start, here in this article I have made the most interesting period in their life. In 2017 a new album came out named simply "Five" because Da Kurlzz has parted ways with the band and retired to spend more time with his family and pursue his own interests in life. Before and after the quarrel with Deuce the band had many popular albums and the show went on.</p>
        <p>After the "Five" they have changed their music style to be more modern, but still trying to be their own. The band keeps on working on the new tracks and albums, always experimenting to this day. Even though HU popularity is not as high as in the late 2000s, the band is far from being dead, as it is rather <b>undead</b></p>
